/**
 * The extension under a real host running in German.
 *
 * `test/integration/l10n.test.ts` holds the catalogues complete and in parity,
 * and says why it cannot show that either mechanism loads: `vscode.l10n.t`
 * resolves against the extension that calls it, and a test file is its own
 * extension with an empty bundle. The help command writes a document whose
 * every sentence goes through the extension's own bundle, so that document
 * is the one runtime string a test can read back in the host's language;
 * the results document holds colors only, and every other string goes to a
 * notification, the status bar or a quick pick. A manifest string cannot be
 * read back through the API, so that half is the catalogue parity test.
 *
 * Launched by the `german host` config in `.vscode-test.mjs`, with
 * `--locale=de` and the German language pack installed into the test profile.
